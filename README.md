# Smart Home Energy Optimization Project
I am currently developing my Smart Home Energy Optimization project. This project aims to adjust the household's electricity consumption and optimize electricity plans to minimize the electricity bill. To predict future consumption, I've employed three different models: LSTM Neural Network, Random Regressor, and SVM. The model that demonstrated the best performance among these was the Random Regressor, which is used to generate future consumption forecasts.

The forecasted data is utilized to identify peak points during crisis scenarios, determining how household appliances should respond. Appliances are categorized as flexible, semi-flexible, and inflexible, exhibiting different behaviors based on crisis situations. This approach significantly improves hourly billing.

Details about the project are thoroughly explained in the comments and markdowns within the "Data-Mining-Project1.ipynb" file. The most significant outcome is expected to provide homeowners with approximately a 17% reduction in their bills.
